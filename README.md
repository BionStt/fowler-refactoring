# fowler-refactoring
Refactoring kata based on M. Flower "Refactoring".

This repository represents "real life" scenario of refactoring a movie rental app. The example is taken from M. Fowler "Refactoring" book. Code has been adopted to C#. Next branches contain each refactoring steps which have been performed. 

I encourage everyone to a lecture of M. Fowler's book.
